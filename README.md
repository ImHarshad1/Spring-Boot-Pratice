🌟 Spring Boot Practice Repository

Welcome to my Spring Boot Practice Hub — a curated collection of projects where I explore, implement, and refine backend development concepts. This repository is my learning playground and portfolio showcase, blending clean code, modern Spring Boot features, and interview‑ready patterns.

📂 Project Modules
Each module demonstrates a specific concept:

SB‑01 REST APIs → Basic REST setup & testing

SB‑02 Product Service → CRUD operations with layered architecture

SB‑03 Layered CRUD → DTO mapping, service abstraction, and clean separation of concerns

SB‑04 Pagination & Sorting → Implemented with Pageable and Sort

SB‑05 Filtering (JPA) → Query‑by‑Example and custom filters

Global Exception Handling → Centralized error management with @ControllerAdvice

🚀 Features Implemented
🔹 CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

🔹 Pagination & Sorting for scalable APIs

🔹 Filtering with Query‑by‑Example (QBE)

🔹 Custom Queries using JPQL & Spring Data conventions

🔹 Global Exception Handling for clean error responses

🔮 Upcoming Enhancements
This repo is evolving into a production‑grade reference. Planned features include:

⚡ Lombok Integration → Reduce boilerplate with annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @Builder

🔐 Spring Security → Role‑based authentication, JWT authorization

✅ Validation → Robust request validation with @Valid, @NotNull, and custom validators

🔄 DTO Mapping → Cleaner API contracts with ModelMapper or MapStruct

📖 Swagger/OpenAPI → Interactive API documentation

🗄️ Database Enhancements → Advanced queries, joins, performance tuning

🧪 Testing → JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test for reliability

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

Framework: Spring Boot

Build Tool: Maven

Database: H2 / PostgreSQL (configurable)

Tools: Git, GitHub, Eclipse/IntelliJ, Postman

📖 API Examples
Delete Product → DELETE /delete/{id}

Search by Name → GET /search?name=phone

Price Range Filter → GET /range?fPrice=100&tPrice=500

🛡️ Vision
This repository is more than practice — it’s a portfolio of backend mastery. Each module demonstrates industry‑standard patterns, preparing me for real‑world projects and interviews. As I add features like Security, Lombok, and Validations, this repo will evolve into a complete Spring Boot reference.
