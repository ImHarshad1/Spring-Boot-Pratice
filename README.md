# 🌟 Spring Boot Practice Repository

Welcome to my Spring Boot Practice Hub — a curated collection of projects where I explore, implement, and refine backend development concepts. This repository is my learning playground and portfolio showcase, blending clean code, modern Spring Boot features, and interview‑ready patterns.

---

## 📂 Project Modules
Each module demonstrates a specific concept:

- **REST APIs** → Basic REST setup & testing  
- **Product Service** → CRUD operations with layered architecture  
- **Layered CRUD** → DTO mapping, service abstraction, and clean separation of concerns  
- **Pagination & Sorting** → Implemented with Pageable and Sort  
- **Filtering (JPA)** → Query‑by‑Example and custom filters  
- **Global Exception Handling** → Centralized error management with @ControllerAdvice
- **Lombok & Validation API** → Simplify boilerplate with Lombok and enforce entity constraints using Jakarta Validation
- **H2 Database** → In‑memory DB setup for rapid CRUD testing and lightweight persistence
- **Java Mail Sender** → Email service integration with JavaMailSender for notifications and communication
- **Spring Data REST** → Auto‑expose repositories as REST endpoints with HAL support
- **Spring Security** → Authentication, authorization, and role‑based access control for secured APIs

## 🚀 Features Implemented
- 🔹 CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- 🔹 Pagination & Sorting for scalable APIs  
- 🔹 Filtering with Query‑by‑Example (QBE)  
- 🔹 Custom Queries using JPQL & Spring Data conventions  
- 🔹 Global Exception Handling for clean error responses
- 🔹 Lombok for boilerplate reduction & Validation API for entity constraints
- 🔹 H2 Database for lightweight in‑memory persistence and testing
- 🔹 Java Mail Sender integration for email notifications
- 🔹 Spring Data REST to auto‑expose repositories as RESTful endpoints
- 🔹 Spring Security with JWT for authentication & role‑based authorization

## 🔮 Upcoming Enhancements
This repo is evolving into a production‑grade reference. Planned features include:

- ⚡ Lombok Integration → Reduce boilerplate with annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @Builder  
- 🔐 Spring Security → Role‑based authentication, JWT authorization  
- ✅ Validation → Robust request validation with @Valid, @NotNull, and custom validators  
- 🔄 DTO Mapping → Cleaner API contracts with ModelMapper or MapStruct  
- 📖 Swagger/OpenAPI → Interactive API documentation  
- 🗄️ Database Enhancements → Advanced queries, joins, performance tuning  
- 🧪 Testing → JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test for reliability

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Language: Java  
- Framework: Spring Boot  
- Build Tool: Maven  
- Database: H2 / PostgreSQL (configurable)  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Eclipse/IntelliJ, Postman, STS  

---

## 📖 API Examples
- Delete Product → `DELETE /delete/{id}`  
- Search by Name → `GET /search?name=phone`  
- Price Range Filter → `GET /range?fPrice=100&tPrice=500`

## 🛡️ Vision
This repository is more than practice — it’s a portfolio of backend mastery. Each module demonstrates industry‑standard patterns, preparing me for real‑world projects and interviews. As I add features like Security, Lombok, and Validations, this repo will evolve into a complete Spring Boot reference.
